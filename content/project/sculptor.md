[Sculptor](http://sculptorgenerator.org) is an [open source](https://github.com/sculptor/sculptor) productivity tool that applies the concepts from [Domain-Driven Design](http://domaindrivendesign.org/books/) and [Domain Specific Languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language).

You express your design intent in a textual specification (within an [Eclipse editor](http://sculptorgenerator.org/documentation/eclipse-plugin)), from which Sculptor generates (with a [Maven plugin](http://sculptorgenerator.org/documentation/maven-plugin)) high quality
Java code and configuration. You can use the concepts from Domain-Driven Design (DDD) in the textual Domain Specific Language (DSL).
E.g. Service, Module, Entity, Value Object, Repository.

The generated code is based on well-known frameworks, such as [JPA](http://java.sun.com/javaee/technologies/persistence.jsp),
[Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org/), [Spring Framework](http://www.springframework.org/) or [Java EE](http://java.sun.com/javaee/).
Sculptor takes care of the technical details, the tedious repetitive work, and let you focus on delivering more business value - and have more fun.
